<h1>Lect Hub</h1>
this is a <b>Laravel</b> project , and its main goal to store all kinds of user uploaded lectures of courses from any university,
so anyone can download it and read it, and of course, any one who upload any pdf, he should do that <b>on his own risk</b>
so <b>after I upload this project to a free host</b>, the user who uploads a pdf is responsible for any <b>copyrights or legal issues</b>.
